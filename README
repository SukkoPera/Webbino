Sukkino
=======
Sukkino is a collection of libraries for the Arduino platform. I originally
wrote them for my own projects but I think many arduinists can take advantage
from them.

All the libraries come with included examples to show how they can be used.
Please also have a look at each library's header files, since the library
behaviour can often be fine-tuned from there.


Webbino
=======
Webbino is a webserver for Arduino with the following features:
- Compatible with both the official Ethernet Shield (based on WizNet's W5100
  chip) and ENC28J60-based shields. This is a unique feature of Webbino, as far
  as I know.
- HTML pages and other data get embedded in the code. This avoids the need of
  an SD card (and, consequently, of the SD access libraries).
- Tags like "#SOMETHING#" in HTML pages can be replaced at page request time,
  allowing the delivery of dynamic contents.
  
The ENC28J60 Ethernet Controller is supported it through the EtherCard library,
so you will need it to compile the sketch. Get it at
https://github.com/jcw/ethercard/.

To switch between the target chipsets, and to enable/disable server features,
have a look at the webbino_common.h file: the USE_ENC28J60 define will enable
support for the ENC28J60 Ethernet Controller. Comment it to enable support for
the W5100 chip (i.e.: official Ethernet Shield). Please be aware of the
following:
- When ENC28J60 support is enabled, a lot of RAM is used for the packet buffer,
  as EtherCard currently needs it to be allocated in the main RAM. It is
  currently set at 800 bytes, which include TCP/IP headers, leaving about 750
  bytes for data to be sent to the client. Since the library also forces all
  communications to be single-packet, about 750 bytes is the maximum size of
  any data that is exchanged between server and client.
- When W5100 support is enabled, more RAM will be free, since the packets are
  stored on a small RAM inside the chip itself. Although, the binary size will
  increase quite a bit: about 5000 bytes. I'm not sure why this happens, as the
  W5100 chip should require much less code than the ENC28J60 to operate.
- Any file that must be available on the webserver can be converted to a C
  header file throught a Python script that is available in the "tools"
  directory. You can then include the generated file in the sketch as shown in
  the examples.

Panic
=====
Panic is a small library that allows writing runtime assertions in Arduino
code, just like the standard C assert.h header. It supports both the standard
assert() mechanism, as well as the glib-inspired assert_not_reached() feature.
Panic will halt the program and print a message on the Serial port and can also
blink a led connected to an Arduino pin whenever an assertion fails.
Assertions can be totally disabled by defining the NDEBUG symbol at compile
time.

EEPROMAnything
==============
EEPROMAnything is just the merger of the functions available on the Arduino
Playground at http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/EEPROMWriteAnything with
the functions of the official EEPROM library, so that you only need to include
a single library to be able to read and write both individual bytes and
arbitrary objects. It also supports a mechanism that transparently redirects
all read/writes to a different EEPROM offset, in order to save write cycles.
